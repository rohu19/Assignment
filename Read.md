Message-Driven Application Documentation
Overview
The message-driven application simulates a producer-consumer scenario using a message queue implemented in core Java. This application consists of several components: Producer, Consumer, MessageQueue, and MessageLogger. The Producer generates messages and adds them to the MessageQueue, while the Consumer retrieves messages from the queue and processes them. The MessageLogger tracks and logs the total number of messages processed successfully and errors encountered.

Components
1. Message.java
Represents a message with an identifier and content.

2. MessageQueue.java
Implements a simple message queue using a LinkedList.

3. Producer.java
Produces messages and puts them into the message queue.

4. Consumer.java
Consumes messages from the message queue and processes them.

5. MessageLogger.java
Logs the total number of messages processed successfully and errors encountered.

6. MessageQueueApp.java
Main application that initializes the message queue, logger, producer, and consumer threads.

Running the Application
To run the message-driven application:

Compile the Source Code:

Compile all .java files (Message.java, MessageQueue.java, Producer.java, Consumer.java, MessageLogger.java, MessageQueueApp.java).
Execute the Application:

Run the MessageQueueApp class to start the producer and consumer threads.
This can typically be done from the command line or an IDE with Java support.
Monitor Output:

The application will output messages indicating successful processing and any errors encountered.
Shutdown:

Once the threads have completed processing, the application will output the total number of messages processed successfully and the number of errors encountered.
Optionally, use Ctrl+C or your IDE's stop button to terminate the application.
Unit Testing
1. Setting Up Unit Tests
The unit tests are designed to verify the functionality of Producer, Consumer, and MessageQueue classes under different scenarios.

JUnit 5 Dependency:

Ensure your project includes the JUnit 5 dependencies for running the tests.
Compile Test Files:

Compile the unit test files (ProducerTest.java, ConsumerTest.java, MessageQueueTest.java).
2. Running Unit Tests
To run the unit tests:

Run Tests:

Execute the JUnit tests from your IDE or use a build tool like Maven or Gradle to run them from the command line.
Review Results:

The test results will indicate whether each component behaves correctly under various scenarios, including successful processing, interruptions, and concurrency.
Adjustments:

Make adjustments to the tests or application components as needed based on specific requirements or additional features.
Conclusion
The message-driven application demonstrates a basic implementation of a producer-consumer pattern using Java, showcasing message queue management and thread synchronization. It's designed to be adaptable for more complex scenarios or integration with external systems.
